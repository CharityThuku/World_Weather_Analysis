# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
- Using API's, weather data across cities was collected to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.

## Purpose
- This analysis looks at different weather patterns around the global and offers insights to travelers who want to book a trip. There are three folders here that offer different levels of analysis: weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.

1. Weather Database.
- This folder uses Open Weather Map API to pull weather information on over 720 different cities around the world. That information consists of: max temperature, wind speed, humidity, current weather description and cloudiness. These categories make it easier for travelers to choose travel destinations.

2. Vacation Search.
- This folder takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location.

3. Vacation Itinerary. 
- This folder takes the search information from the search folder and uses Google Maps directions API to create a vacation itinerary.
